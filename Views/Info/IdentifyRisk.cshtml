    <h4>Established Results</h4>
    <p>The Previdence system has been built upon a tested risk model that has been used successfully to reduce behavioral risk and treat mental illness since the mid 1990's.</p>
    <p>It began as a paper-based system to identify suicide and sexual perversions. In 2004 the paper-based system was converted into a software toolkit. With the aid of the computer, correlative algorithm analysis was effectively used to reduce suicide in soldiers by 56% and greatly reduce homicidal ideations. In the school districts using Previdence, suicide has been greatly reduced.</p>
    <h5>Identify Risk</h5>
    <p>Previdence Assessment Technology allows a clinician to assess the mental health of an individual and identify mental illness and risky behavior using established protocols.</p>
    <h5>Measure Risk</h5>
    <p>Previdence Risk Analysis Technology allows a clinician to take "snapshots" of the risk at any time and determine the level of potential threat.</p>
    <h5>Manage Risk</h5>
    <p>Previdence builds an individualized Management/Safety plan for each patient based upon their own responses to the assessments.</p>
    <h5>Monitor Risk</h5>
    <p>Each time a snapshot is taken risk is further evaluated to continually monitoring progress of treatment.</p>
