                                    If you use an email address provided by a organization you are affiliated with (e.g. an employer or school) to order a Service as an individual, you represent that you have authority to use that organization’s domain to sign up for a Subscription in your capacity as a member of that organization. The organization, as the owner of the domain associated with your email address, may assume control over and manage your use of the Services. In such a case, your organization’s designated administrator (your “admin”) may (i) control and administer your account, including modifying and terminating your access and (ii) access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. Previdence may inform you that your organization has assumed control of the Services covered by your Subscription, but Previdence is under no obligation to provide such notice. If your organization is administering your use of the Services or managing the tenant associated with your Subscription, direct your data subject requests and privacy inquiries to your administrator. If your organization is not administering your use of the Service or managing such tenant, direct your data subject requests and privacy inquiries to Previdence.
