                            An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND PREVIDENCE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.

                            You and Previdence agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.

If you and Previdence do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Previdence may commence an arbitration. Written notice to Previdence must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Arbitration Notice, Previdence Corporation, 5685 South 1475 East, Suite 2B, South Ogden, Utah 84405.

The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.

Previdence agrees not to seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.
